# Anagrams

## About
This is a project where I created an Anagrams game using Python. It contains a large dictionary, two different gamemodes, a points system based on the length of words and complexity of letters used, and more.

## How to play?
Replace '/PATH/TO/enigmix.csv' in line 8 of main.py to your local path to enigmix.csv, then run main.py
